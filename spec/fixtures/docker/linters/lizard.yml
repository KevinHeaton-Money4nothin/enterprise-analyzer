help: 'We cannot say enough nice things about Terry Yin. He is the creator of Lizard:
  A simple code complexity analyser that does not need header files or complilation
  for many popular languages. It is fast, reliable and we recently supported the addition
  of C# (namely as there was no reliable open source complexity tools available).
  We score this based on 7 being the ideal and then about 0.1 tech debt line for complexity
  above that.'
